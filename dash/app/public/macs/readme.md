## getting these images

I used to use this api (I think...):

- https://di-api.reincubate.com/v1/apple-serials/C07D92QVPJJ9
- https://di-api.reincubate.com/v1/apple-identifiers/iPhone9,3/
- https://di-api.reincubate.com/v1/apple-identifiers/Mac14,15/

...but they seem to be not updating for new models, or I can't figure out how to get them,
sometimes I get not found, other times data with no image or anything else than repeating
the model identifier.

I ended up using images from ipsw.me, like: https://ipsw.dev/img/devices/webp/Mac15,5.webp
-- these seem to follow a strict convention of using the model identifiers as the
filename, I just cropped each one tIght and converted it to .png in Snagit.

There may be a better source somewhere.
