{% .lead .mb-12 %} Today we're excited to announce the release of
**[Gertrude AM](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gertrude-am/id6753187429)**, a podcast app
with parental controls for iOS. It works like a normal podcast app, with one key
difference: parents set a **PIN code at setup** that's required to search for and add new
shows. Kids can listen to approved podcasts and get new episodes automatically, but they
can't search for or subscribe to inappropriate content.

## The Problem: How to Block Inappropriate Podcasts

Podcasts are everywhere now, and a lot of them are great for kids. But most podcast apps
don't have parental controls. Apple Podcasts doesn't let you restrict what kids can search
for or prevent kids from subscribing to new shows. Your child can find literally anything.

And plenty of podcasts have content parents wouldn't want their kids
hearing&mdash;explicit language, sexual topics, violent themes. There's no age rating
system, no content filters, nothing to stop kids from finding inappropriate audio content,
not to mention perusing suggestive or explicit show and episode artwork.

## A Simple Solution: Searching and Subscribing Requires a PIN

Gertrude AM solves this with one simple feature: When you first set it up, you create a
PIN code. From then on, that PIN is required any time someone wants to search for or add a
new podcast.

Once you've approved a show, it works normally. Kids can browse episodes, play what they
want, download for offline listening. When new episodes come out, they show up
automatically. The app gets out of the way and lets them enjoy the content you've
approved.

But they can't search the podcast directory. They can't subscribe to new shows. They're
restricted to exactly what you've already decided is appropriate.

Set your PIN, approve the shows your kids can listen to, and you're done. No complicated
settings, no workarounds, just a safe way for kids to listen to podcasts on their iPhone.

## Try It Today

Gertrude AM is available now in the
[App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gertrude-am/id6753187429). If you've been
looking for a password protected podcast app or a way to approve podcasts before kids
listen, this is it.
