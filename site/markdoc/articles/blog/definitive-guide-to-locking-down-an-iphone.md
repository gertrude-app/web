  A step-by-step guide to completely locking down an iPhone or iPad, for parents who are
  serious about protecting their kids from the dangers of unrestricted online activity.
category: parental-controls
---

{% .lead %} With a little hard work, it's possible to entirely lock down an iPhone or iPad
so that it is _extremely safe_ for your child to use. Thanks to Apple, parents have all
the tools they need to control access, apps, and internet content. The bad news is that
these controls are scattered over an unintuitive hodge-podge of settings screens, and
there are several important loopholes that are easy to miss. This tutorial will walk you
step-by-step through the entire process.

{% callout title="What do you mean by <b class='underline'>safe</b>?" %}

Many parents naively think that the primary danger posed by internet-connected devices is
that they could allow **predators to gain access to your child.** While this is a
legitimate danger and a horrific tragedy whenever it occurs, it is nevertheless
**relatively rare** and often distracts parents from dealing with the dangers which
**almost certainly will affect their kids.**

What is sadly **unbelievably common** is for adolescents of both sexes&mdash;because of
their own innate curiousity, surging hormones, and lack of impulse control&mdash;to
develop lifelong addictions to pornography or to be deeply scarred by engaging with other
types of socially and emotionally damaging content and behavior on the internet.

You wouldn't fill your child's closet with hard-core adult magazines and hope they would
have enough self-control to never look inside. Giving your child a phone that is not
thoroughly locked down is _exactly the same._

As unpleasant as it might be, it's worth familiarizing yourself with some of the
[heart-breaking statistics,](https://www.guardchild.com/statistics/) like:

- 90% of children ages 8-16 have seen online pornography
- 70% of children ages 7-18 have _accidentally_ encountered porn searching the web while
  doing homework
- the largest group of internet porn consumers is children ages 12-17
- 22% of teenage girls say they have posted nude or semi-nude photos of themselves online
- 37% of the internet is pornography

## The Safest Phone is No Phone

Before you get to work locking down your child's iPhone with this tutorial, I'd be remiss
if I didn't advocate for what I think is the simplest and most effective way to protect
your child, and that is&mdash;**don't give them a phone**. It's become incredibly common
for almost all kids to have phones, but it truly doesn't have to be that way. I would
highly advise you to hold out as long as you possibly can before giving your kids a phone.
And if you already have given them one, think hard about taking it back.

I am the father of four children (currently 16, 15, 12, and 9), and only my oldest son has
a phone, which he got a few weeks _after_ his 16th birthday. Many generations of kids have
survived their pre-teen and adolescent years without a phone, and yours can too. I realize
it's going against an extremely strong societal norm, but absolutely nothing beats the
simplicity and safety of them simply not having a phone. And there's a growing amount of
[research](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.669042/full) showing
that you might be greatly helping their cognitive and emotional development.

{% callout title="iPhones, iPads &nbsp; . . . and Androids" %}

For brevity's sake, the rest of this tutorial only refers to **iPhones**, but these steps
work the same for **iPads.**

However, none of what you'll find below applies to **Android phones or tablets**. While
there certainly are some tools and apps for parental controls on an Android, in my
opinion, they are **far less powerful and safe** than the deeply integrated controls Apple
provides. It's enough of a difference to warrant spending the extra money on an Apple
device, or considering a phone designed for parental controls like
[Gabb](https://gabbwireless.com/) or [Bark](https://www.bark.us/bark-phone/) rather than
an Android.

## Start by deleting apps

The iPhone comes with many built-in apps, and before you started working to lock down your
child's phone, you or they may have installed more. Therefore, the first thing you should
do is _delete every single app_ that they don't need or you haven't thoroughly checked for
safety. A child's phone is a tool, not an entertainment device. It should definitely
**not** allow them to surf the web, play non-educational games, search for and install
apps, or access music, videos, or social media content from the internet.

To delete an app, tap and _hold_ it's icon, until you see the option to _remove_ it:

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/remove-app.png" alt="locking down an iPhone: how to delete an app" /%}

Then tap to _delete the app_:

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/delete-app.png" alt="locking down an iPhone: confirm deleting an app" /%}

{% callout %}

For some reason, a few of the apps provided by Apple **do not give you the option to
delete** them&mdash;they only allow you to remove them from the home screen. If you
encounter some of these, don't worry, we'll vanquish them with the techniques explained
below.

{% /callout %}

{% callout type="warning" %}

Both the **Apple Maps** and **Google Maps** apps can be used to view **nude photos,** and
should be deleted. For more details (including a recommendation for a replacement),
[see here](/docs/five-things-you-forgot-when-locking-down-your-kids-iphone#4-explicit-images-in-maps-apps).

{% /callout %}

## Disable Siri Integrations

The next thing you need to do is take a moment to _disable some Siri integration
settings_. It's important to do this _before_ disabling Siri entirely via Screen Time
(explained below) because once Siri is disabled, these options are no longer visible, but
are still in effect.

Start by going to the main **Settings App**.

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/main-settings-app.png" caption="Go to the main <b>Settings</b> app" alt="locking down an iPhone: the main Settings app" /%}

Scroll down, and tap **Siri & Search**.

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/siri-search-main.png" caption="Tap Siri & Search" alt="locking down an iPhone: Siri & Search settings" /%}

Then disable all the settings shown below:

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/siri-disable-all.png" caption="Turn <b>all</b> of these settings OFF" alt="locking down an iPhone: disable all Siri system integrations for safety" /%}

{% callout type="warning" %}

It's critically important that you disable **Show in Look Up** and **Show in Spotlight**.
These settings are hard to understand and often missed by parents when locking down a
child's phone. If you don't disable these settings, your child will be able to
[search for and view images and content](/docs/five-things-you-forgot-when-locking-down-your-kids-iphone)
from the internet through their phone's search and look up features.

{% /callout %}

## Getting Started with Screen Time

Now that we've got apps deleted and Siri integrations turned off, we'll turn our attention
to **Screen Time**, which is the main tool Apple gives you to lock down an iOS device. You
may already be familiar with Screen Time, because many adults use it to track how much
time they spend on their phones, which is one of it's primary purposes. But it also has
some really powerful features to _completely control what your kid has access to._

To get started, go to **Settings &rarr; Screen Time**, as shown below:

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/settings-screentime.png" caption="Settings &rarr; Screen Time" alt="locking down an iPhone: start at 'Settings' -> 'Screen Time'" /%}

Then, click to _turn on_ Screen Time:

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/turn-on-screentime.png" caption="Turn on Screen Time, then click 'Continue'" alt="locking down an iPhone: tap to turn onn Screen Time" /%}

### "My iPhone" or "My Child's"

The next prompt will ask you if the phone is "My iPhone", or "My Child's".

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/mine-or-childs.png" caption="Read below for guidance on what to choose..." alt="locking down an iPhone: what to do when it asks you 'Is This iPhone for Yourself or Your Child?'?" /%}

You can select _either_ option, however, if you choose "My Child's", you'll need to have
**Family Sharing** already set up. You can pause at this point and set up Family Sharing
if you want, by following the
[instructions here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201088). The benefit of setting up
Family Sharing and choosing "My Child's" is that you'll be able to control their settings
and view reports of activity _from your own device._ The only real downsides are the time
it takes to do the initial setup of Family Sharing, and a restriction that once your kids
turn 18, they will be able to disable these restrictions themselves. On the other hand, if
you choose "This is My iPhone" you'll still be able to protect the device to the same
degree, you'll just have to make any changes _from your child's device_ rather than from
your own. If you're not sure what to do, I recommend choosing **My iPhone**, only because
it's a little simpler to get started.

At this point, the instructions for continuing **briefly diverge,** depending on what
choice you made between "My iPhone" or "My Child's".

### Setup wizard steps for Family Sharing

{% callout %}

**Skip this section if you chose "My iPhone"** in the preceding step. You won't see the
below screens, and you'll rejoin us in the next section.

{% /callout %}

If you chose _"My Child's iPhone",_ you'll be presented with several screens guiding you
through some setup steps. Skip past all three screens shown below.

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/wizard-skip.png" caption="Skip these screens" alt="locking down an iPhone: skip these screens when setting up Screen Time" /%}

When it prompts you to _enter your Apple ID,_ click **cancel**.

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/wizard-passcode-recovery.png" caption="Skip this step by clicking <b>cancel</b>" alt="locking down an iPhone: enter your Apple ID to allow for Screen Time passcode recovery" /%}

### Setting a passcode

At this point, if you are setting up your child's iPhone _without_ Family Sharing you'll
need to click the button labeled **Use Screen Time passcode**, shown below. Otherwise, you
should already be seeing the screen prompting you to set a passcode.

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/use-screen-time-passcode.png" caption="If not using Family Sharing, tap to set a passcode" alt="locking down an iPhone: click 'Use Screen Time Passcode' and set a totally unique 4-digit code" /%}

Which will bring up _this screen_ (if it's not already up), where you should enter and
confirm a _4 digit passcode:_

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/set-passcode.png" caption="Set and confirm your UNIQUE passcode" alt="locking down an iPhone: when prompted, choose a unique passcode to protect Screen Time" /%}

{% callout type="warning" title="Choose a unique passcode!" %}

It's very important that you choose an **entirely new and random** 4 digit passcode.
Please do not use something easily guessable by your child, like a birthday, your street
address, your debit card pin, or any 4 digit number you may have ever used for a padlock
or alarm system, or anything like that. Most people re-use the same pins and combinations,
so if you don't choose something totally unique for this passcode, it's very likely your
child will be able to easily guess it.

{% /callout %}

{% callout type="warning" title="Careful with that passcode!" %}

**If your child is able to see you while you're entering this code,** it's extremely easy
for them to remember it. It's worth it to be _very paranoid_ about this. My friend's son
learned his parent's passwords by secretly watching them type, and ended up using their
devices to look at porn.

I make my kids look away whenever I'm entering a password, I frequently change my
passwords, and I'm especially careful with their Screen Time passcode&mdash;holding the
phone only inches from my chest when entering the numbers.

{% /callout %}

## Downtime

The Screen Time controls have five main sections. We'll work through them one by one,
starting with **Downtime**, although we'll have the most to say about the fifth area,
which is the most important.

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/downtime.png" caption="Downtime" alt="locking down an iPhone: 'Downtime' controls, used to specify schedules for permitted activity" /%}

**Downtime** allows you to _enforce a scheduled period_ when your child has no access (or
limited access) to their device. While not strictly necessary to keep your kids safe,
enabling Downtime is almost always a good idea. Kids (especially teenagers) are often
awake for hours in the early part of the night, and if they have access to their phones
and are bored, bad things frequently happen. Restricting their device usage at night also
helps encourage good sleep habits.

Tap to enable a scheduled downtime, and set the schedule for a time that seems appropriate
for your child.

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/scheduled-downtime.png" caption="Enabled Scheduled Downtime" alt="locking down an iPhone: tap to enable scheduled Downtime" /%}

{% callout type="warning" %}

Be sure to select **Block at Downtime** as well (shown below). If you _don't_ enable it,
your child will be able to ignore the Downtime schedule, rendering it little more than a
suggestion.

{% /callout %}

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/block-at-downtime.png" caption="Turn on 'Block at Downtime'" alt="locking down an iPhone: be sure to turn on 'Block at Downtime', or else Downtime limits can be overridden by your child" /%}

## App Limits

The next section on the main screen is for **App Limits**.

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/app-limits.png" caption="App Limits" alt="locking down an iPhone: App Limits settings" /%}

This tutorial won't cover App Limits in depth, because they're not central to protecting
your kids. Every app that could be dangerous should be completely blocked by techniques
shown later in this tutorial. If you have some apps that you only want grant limited time
for each day, then App Limits can be a useful tool for that end.

In my opinion, web-browsing (Safari) and all social media apps should be _entirely
eliminated_ from your child's iPhone, not regulated with time limits. Phones should
provide only tools for communication (email, phone, and texting), plus required safe apps
for school and work, as needed. Web browsing should only be done on a computer, ideally in
a public place, with a tool like [Gertrude](/) to restrict access and provide supervision.

## Communication Limits

The next section on the main screen is for **Communication Limits**.

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/communication-limits.png" caption="Communication Limits" alt="locking down an iPhone: Communication Limits settings" /%}

The **Communication Limits** settings area (shown below) allows you to control who your
child can communicate with.

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/communication-limits-settings.png" caption="Communication Limits settings" alt="locking down an iPhone: the inner screen of settings for Screen Time Communication Limits" /%}

Depending on your particular situation, it might be wise and appropriate to limit
communication to specifically approved contacts, or prohibit communication during
Downtime. But as this area is not usually critical for safety and is highly dependent on
your child and unique context, we won't try to give any guidelines in this tutorial.

## Always Allowed

The next section on the main screen is for **Always Allowed**.

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/always-allowed.png" caption="Always Allowed" alt="locking down an iPhone: Always Allowed lets you specify apps not subject to Downtime" /%}

This section is a bit confusing. In my opinion it should be a screen within the Downtime
settings area. It's only normal purpose is to _bypass Downtime restrictions_ in certain
ways.

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/always-allowed-settings.png" caption="These settings allow you to <b>bypass</b> Downtime restrictions" alt="locking down an iPhone: Always Allowed settings let you pick apps that are not subject to Downtime schedule restrictions" /%}

A good example of a good _Allowed App_ would be the **Clock** app, if you wanted your
child to be able to use their iPhone as an alarm clock, and have access to set it after
their Downtime schedule kicks in.

You can also add exemptions for certain contacts that can always be contacted, no matter
what time it is. Used sparingly, these controls can provide a nice layer of needed
customization on top of the Downtime restrictions.

## Content &amp; Privacy Restrictions

If your goal is to completely lock down your child's iPhone, making it a truly safe
device, most of the controls you're going to need to set are in the fifth and final
section, labeled **Content & Privacy Restrictions**:

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/content-privacy-restrictions.png" caption="Most of your work will happen in this section" alt="locking down an iPhone: Cthe Screen Time > Content & Privacy Restrictions area is where most of the important controls and settings live" /%}

Start by tapping to _enable restrictions:_

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/enable-restrictions.png" caption="Toggle to enable Content & Privacy Restrictions" alt="locking down an iPhone: click to enable Content & Privacy Restrictions" /%}

### iTunes &amp; App Store Purchases

Then drill into the section labeled _iTunes &amp; App Store Purchases_, shown below:

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/itunes-app-store-purchases.png" caption="Tap to drill into iTunes & App Store next" alt="locking down an iPhone: Content & Privacy Restrictions > iTunes & App Store Purchases" /%}

For a safe iPhone, all three of these options should be set to **Don't allow**.

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/dont-allow-installing-deleting-apps.png" caption="<b>Don't allow</b> installing, deleting, or in-app purchases" alt="locking down an iPhone: don't allow installing apps, deleting apps, or in-app purchases" /%}

{% callout title="Managing Apps Over Time" %}

You can still add new apps you approve when you child needs them. You just temporarily
allow installing apps in this section, install the app, and then revoke the installation
privilege again.

Same with _deleting_ apps: just temporarily allow deleting, remove the app, and
re-disable.

{% /callout %}

### Allowed Apps

Next, tap the back button to get back to the _Content & Privacy Restrictions_ screen, and
then tap to select the second section, labeled **Allowed Apps**:

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/allowed-apps.png" caption="Go back one screen, then choose <b>Allowed Apps</b>" alt="locking down an iPhone: Content & Privacy Restrictions > Allowed Apps" /%}

This is another section that is a bit confusing at the outset, because there is another
screen at the main level called **Always Allowed** that looks very similar. That screen
let you exempt certain apps from Downtime. This screen lets you enable/disable apps
entirely, irrespective of Downtime.

This is an **extremely important area** because it's the only way you can disable/remove
certain apps, like **Safari**&mdash;the built-in app for surfing the web which is the
single most dangerous app on your child's iPhone.

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/disable-safari-siri.png" caption="Disable any apps you want to block. Be sure to disable <b class='underline'>Safari</b> and Siri" alt="locking down an iPhone: disable apps that Apple doesn't let you delete" /%}

Work through the list of apps, _leaving enabled **only the apps** that are truly
necessary, and you're **sure are safe**_. We encourage you to take a _very conservative_
approach: kids' phones should be very minimal. The more apps you allow, the more chance
you've accidentally opened up something that could allow them unrestricted access to the
internet.

{% callout title="How do I know if an app is safe?" %}

The only way to really know is to **thoroughly test** it. It's very important to
understand that apps with a very benign purpose can have **serious loopholes** you may not
have thought of.

**One story** might help drive this home. At one point I was considering allowing the
_Audible_ app (for listening to audiobooks) on an old phone we had lying around. I figured
as long as I controlled which books were downloaded (because my kids didn't have the
ability to purchase a new book), the app should be safe, right? I took a few minutes to
explore the app, and found that there was a feature where you could search for new
audiobooks. A few simple search terms filled the screen with **adult books with
semi-pornagraphic covers.** I deleted the app.

Whenever you're about to allow a new app, take 5 minutes exploring the app. Imagine
someone will give you $10,000 if you can find inappropriate content on it. You'd be
surprised how often you can.

{% /callout %}

{% callout title="What about web research?" %}

Kids shouldn't be doing homework research on a phone, period. For starters, a phone is not
the right tool for serious academic research. And further, researching on the web is
actually a very high-risk activity:
[70% of children](https://www.guardchild.com/statistics/) ages 7-18 have accidentally
encountered porn searching the web while doing homework.

In our household, research for homework is always done on a computer, either under direct
parental supervision, or with filtering and screen recording provided by the Gertrude app.

{% /callout %}

{% callout title="Do I need to disable Siri?" type="warning" %}

Parents often don't realize this, but having access to Siri puts the entire internet at
your child's fingertips. Even if you have Safari blocked, Siri offers an alternative
method of searching and browsing the internet. Your child can simply ask Siri to look
something up, and she will happily respond with snippets of content **including images**.

{% /callout %}

### Content Restrictions

Next, tap the back button to get back to the _Content & Privacy Restrictions_ screen, and
then tap to move into the second section, labled **Content Restrictions**:

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/content-restrictions.png" caption="Go back one screen, then choose <b>Content Restrictions</b>" alt="locking down an iPhone: Content Restrictions, where many of the most important settings live" /%}

Which brings you to this screen:

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/content-restrictions-settings.png" alt="locking down an iPhone: Screen Time > Content & Privacy Restrictions > Content Restrictions" /%}

There's a lot to take in on this screen. Loads of different settings. Go through _each
setting_ one by one, _turning it to the **safest (or most disabled) option,**_ unless you
have a good reason to do otherwise. For example, anywhere it offers you the options of
"Clean" or "Explicit", choose "Clean", if it offers "Off" and "On" choose "Off", and if it
offers "Don't Allow" or "Allow" choose "Don't Allow".

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/clean-not-explicit.png" caption="choose CLEAN, OFF, or DON'T ALLOW for most options" alt="locking down an iPhone: choose 'clean', 'off', or 'don't allow' for most options in Content Restrictions" /%}

Three of the sub-sections deserve particular attention, the first is **Apps**:

### Content Restrictions &rarr; Apps

Within _Content & Privacy Restrictions_, there is another section labled **Apps**, as
shown below:

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/content-restrictions-apps.png" alt="locking down an iPhone: the 'Apps' section of Content Restrictions has to do with app age ratings" /%}

In my opinion, this area should be renamed as well. It's confusing because this is the
third screen that seems to control access to apps, we've already seen _Always Allowed_
apps, and _Allowed Apps_, and now here we have just _Apps_.

The purpose of this area is really to control **what age rating** of apps may be
installed, which you can see from the drill-down screen:

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/app-age-rating.png" caption="This screen should be called <b>App Age Rating</b>" alt="locking down an iPhone: understanding the Content Restrictions > Apps screen" /%}

Set this to `12+` or even `Allow All`&mdash;your child can't install apps anyway, and you
will be approving every app individually. Setting it too low can cause mysterious missing
apps (see below).

{% callout title="An app I installed for my child won't show up!" type="warning" %}

If you chose a very conservative value like `4+` for your app _age rating_, some apps you
want your kids to use may **dissappear**. To fix this, just make sure you have removed the
right to install apps, and then set the age limit to a higher level and the app should
reappear.

{% /callout %}

### Content Restrictions &rarr; Web

The second area that requires some more detailed explanation is the **Web Content**
drill-down:

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/web-content.png" alt="locking down an iPhone: Content Restrictions > Web Content" /%}

It is critical that you choose **Allowed Websites Only** for this section.

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/allowed-websites-only.png" caption="Make <b>sure</b> you select 'Allowed Websites Only'" alt="locking down an iPhone: Content Restrictions > Web Content should be set to 'Allowed Websites Only'" /%}

Even if you have taken our recomendation to _entirely disable web-browsing by removing the
Safari app_, you still need to set this setting to _Allowed Websites Only_. That's because
many apps have what amounts to a built-in web-browser, and reach out to the internet to
load content when your child is using them. Without this setting chosen, otherwise safe
apps can become alternative portals to the internet.

{% callout title="Why not 'Limit Adult Websites'?" type="warning" %}

It might be tempting to choose the second option: **Limit Adult Websites**, but we urge
you not to. If you do, you're trusting that someone has correctly identified and
categorized over 2 billion websites, and is staying on top of the nearly 250,000 new
websites being created every day. I've personally tested a filter that blocks **millions**
of known adult domains, and it still took only a few minutes to find explicit content that
was unblocked.

{% /callout %}

### Content Restrictions &rarr; Siri

The third and final area that deserves special treatment is the **Siri &rarr; Web Search
Content:**

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/siri-web-search-content.png" alt="locking down an iPhone: be sure to disallow Siri > Web Search Content" /%}

Make sure you've got this set to **Don't Allow.**

## Testing it Out

Once you've got all your settings dialed in, you'll need to spend a few minutes testing.
Exit out of the Settings app, and start kicking the tires. Check and make sure that no
apps are available that you did not intend to make available. Double-check that Siri is
not working. This would also be a good time to double-check all of your approved apps. Use
the thought experiment I proposed above: spend a few minutes with each app, imagining you
would immediately win $10,000 if you could find something inappropriate or dangerous.
Imagine you are a bored, impulsive, motivated teenager with a lot of persistence and time
on their hands.

## Having the Right Mindset

I wish I could tell you that there's _"one simple trick"_ or some _silver-bullet
technology_ to easily and perfectly protect your kids in this new world we live in.
There's not. The reality is that **it's going to take time, effort, and diligence** to
keep your kids safe online. It will be _annoying, frustrating, and inconvenient_ at times,
and will interrupt your day frequently. There will be a _constant temptation to simplify
your life_ by disabling protections and telling yourself that "my kid will be OK."

But don't despair, this really is possible. An enormously important step is just to settle
it ahead of time that you're willing to put in the time and effort to actually keep them
safe. Your kids might moan and groan, but they'll survive&mdash;and thank you one day.
Stay the course, it's worth it.

Once you've got your kids iPhone locked down, I urge you to think carefully about their
**computer usage** as well. If your kid has a Mac, you might want to check out
[Gertrude,](/) the app I built to keep my own kids safe while doing school online.
