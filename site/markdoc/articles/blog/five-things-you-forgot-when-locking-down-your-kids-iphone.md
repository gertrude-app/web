{% .lead .mb-12 %} I consider myself pretty tech-savvy&mdash;I've been a software
developer for 15 years, and even have apps in the App store. So when I locked down my
oldest son's first iPhone, I was fairly confident I had covered all my bases. But boy, was
I wrong. _Grab your child's phone **right this minute** and check if you missed any of
these too._

## 1. `#images` iMessage App

{% callout type="warning" title="iOS 17/18 Update" %}

The instructions below only work for **iOS 16.** Starting with iOS 17, Apple removed the
ability to disable this dangerous feature.

For **iOS 18** the only way to disable this feature is to install the free
[Gertrude Blocker iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gertrude-blocker/id6736368820) we
created specifically to close this and other loopholes in Screen Time.

For **iOS 17**, you can either install the
[Gertrude Blocker app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gertrude-blocker/id6736368820), or
set your childs phone to always be in "Downtime" mode, by setting a schedule for Downtime
from 3:01am until 3:00am every day. In doing so, you do lose the ability to use Downtime
normally.

{% /callout %}

Apple's built-in **Messages** app comes with a growing number of app-integrations (called
`iMessage apps`) that allow for sending non-text items in text messages.

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/imessage-apps.png" caption="this row of mini-apps is shown when composing a text message" alt="five things you forgot locking down your kids iPhone: iMessage mini-apps can expose your child to explicit content" /%}

If your child clicks on the `#images` (Hashtag Images) app (shown above), they are able to
_search through a huge inventory of animated gifs_. The image below shows a harmless
search query, but there are loads of sexually suggestive and otherwise inappropriate
images your child shouldn't be able to browse.

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/messages-images.png" caption="close of up the '#images' app" alt="five things you forgot locking down your kids iPhone: the #images app should be removed for your child's safety" /%}

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/searching-images.png" caption="Imagine I searched for something other than 'GOATS'" alt="five things you forgot locking down your kids iPhone: searchable animated gifs your child should have access to" /%}

{% click-to-reveal title="Show me how to fix it" %}

**Step 1.** Scroll to the far right and tap on the _more_ (**•••**) icon:

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/messages-more.png" caption="Scroll to the right and click this icon" alt="five things you forgot locking down your kids iPhone: start by clicking the 'more' icon to remove the #images app" /%}

**Step 2.** Next, swipe left to remove the app from _Favorites_.

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/images-remove-from-favorites.png" caption="Swipe left to 'Remove from Favorites'" alt="five things you forgot locking down your kids iPhone: swipe left to remove #images from favorites" /%}

**Step 3.** Then the app will appear in the section labeled _MORE APPS_. Swipe left again
in this section to fully delete the app:

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/images-delete-app.png" caption="Swipe left to delete the app once and for all" alt="five things you forgot locking down your kids iPhone: then delete the #images app" /%}

**Step 4.** Repeat for any other iMessage Apps that may already be installed. The
`#images` app is the most dangerous app, but we also recommend deleting the rest of them,
with the exception of the _Photos_ app.

**Step 5.** Ensure that your child doesn't have the ability to _re-install_ this (or any
other) app by going to "Settings > Screen Time > Content & Privacy Restrictions > iTunes &
App Store Purchases" and choose _Don't Allow_ for "Installing Apps":

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/dont-allow-installing-apps.png" caption="Remove authority to install apps, or they can re-install" alt="five things you forgot locking down your kids iPhone: remove authority to install apps to prevent more unsafe iMessage apps" /%}

{% callout type="warning" alt=true %}

This same exploit also exists on the Messages app **for the Mac.** Unfortunately, there
doesn't seem to be a similar way to delete `#images` on macOS. If your child uses a Mac
computer, the only way to remove this is by deleting the Messages app, or using an
internet filter program like [Gertrude](/) to block searching for innappropriate images.

{% /callout %}

{% callout title="What's with all the goats? 🐐" %}

In order to avoid filling this post with harmful images, all of the examples show pictures
of **goats.** Every time you see one, **imagine your child were searching for something
sexually explicit** or otherwise inappropriate.

{% /callout %}

## 2. Explicit Images in Maps Apps

The built-in Apple Maps app and Google Maps are (surprisingly) not safe for kids, and
should be deleted. They are unsafe because both apps will show _any images_ that may have
been uploaded by business owners or patrons. For instance, _many strip clubs post nude
photos_ which can be accessed through these apps. No Screen Time setting can prevent these
images from being viewed, the only way to secure your child's phone is to delete the apps.
(In the "how to fix" section below we recommend an alternate map/navigation app.)

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/maps-images.png" caption="The images from strip clubs and adult bookstores aren't so innocent" alt="five things you forgot locking down your kids iPhone: Apple Maps and Google Maps can show explicit photos to your child" /%}

{% click-to-reveal title="Show me how to fix it" %}

**Step 1.** Temporarily _allow deleting apps_ in Screen Time by going to "Settings >
Screen Time > Content & Privacy Restrictions > iTunes & App Store Purchases", as shown
below:

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/screentime-content-privacy-restrictions.png" caption="Go to \"Settings > Screen Time > Content & Privacy Restrictions\"" alt="five things you forgot locking down your kids iPhone: go to Settings > Screen Time > Content & Privacy Restrictions" /%}

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/itunes-app-store-purchases.png" caption="Then to \"iTunes & App Store Purchases\"" alt="five things you forgot locking down your kids iPhone: iTunes and App Store Purchases" /%}

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/allow-deleting-apps.png" caption="Temporarily ALLOW deleting apps" alt="five things you forgot locking down your kids iPhone: temporarily allow deleting apps" /%}

You may find that you are already allowing Deleting apps. If so, just leave the setting as
is, but we do recommend you revoke that privilege after deleting the map apps.

**Step 2.** Power off and restart the phone.

{% callout alt=true %}

If you've already deleted Apple Maps and are **only deleting Google Maps**, you can skip
this step.

{% /callout %}

Once you've allowed deleting apps, you won't actually be able to delete _Apple Maps_ until
you fully power off the phone and restart. To power off the phone, hold down the "side"
button and the "volume down" button at the same time.

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/slide-to-power-off.png" caption="Strangely, you have to power off before you can delete Apple maps" alt="five things you forgot locking down your kids iPhone: hold down side and volume down buttons to power off" /%}

After the phone has powered off, turn it on again by holding the right side button until
the Apple logo appears.

**Step 3.** Delete the app/s.

Once you've allowed deleting apps and restarted the phone after a full power-off, you can
_now_ click and hold the icon of the Apple maps (and/or the Google Maps app) and choose to
delete it.

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/delete-apple-maps.png" caption="Press and hold the icon to delete Apple Maps" alt="five things you forgot locking down your kids iPhone: how to delete Apple Maps with Screen Time" /%}

**Step 4.** Now that the app is deleted, _forbid again the ability to delete apps_ by
going back to "Settings > Screen Time > Content & Privacy Restrictions > iTunes & App
Store Purchases":

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/disallow-deleting-apps.png" caption="Remove the ability to delete apps again" alt="five things you forgot locking down your kids iPhone: then re-disable deleting apps" /%}

**Step 5.** Disable automatic software updates.

Every time iOS updates (which can happen automatically, without any intervention, during
the night when the phone is charging), the Apple Maps app _may_ come back. We aren't 100%
sure how often it does, it may only be for the large, yearly major iOS versions that
usually happen in the fall, or it may be more often&mdash;but it _definitely_ happens.

Go to the Settings app on your child's phone, then navigate to "General > Software
Update > Automatic Update", and disable all three options shown below:

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/disable-automatic-updates.png" caption="In Settings > General > Software Updates" alt="five things you forgot locking down your kids iPhone: disable automatic iOS software updates" /%}

{% callout alt=true type="warning" %}

Sadly, there is no way for you to prevent your child from turning automatic updates back
on. Therefore, we recommend that you **a)** don't show them this setting area, and **b)**
check this setting on their phone frequently, ideally when you notice your own phone has
updated, and **c)** proactively update their phones manually on a regular basis, so you
can check for the reappearance of Maps and other safety concerns, and also remove any
incentive for them to change this setting.

{% /callout %}

{% callout alt=true %}

If your child needs a map/navigation app, at the time of this writing (2/8/2023) the
**Waze** app does not allow viewing of business images, and should be a safe alternative
for older teens who need a turn-by-turn direction app.

{% /callout %}

## 3. Internet Content in Searches

To test if your child's phone is vulnerable to this commonly missed item, _**pull down**
from the middle of the home screen_ to access the iPhone's built-in _search prompt_.

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/spotlight-search.png" caption="Swipe down bring up search, then type a search phrase" alt="five things you forgot locking down your kids iPhone: spotlight searching on an iPhone can access internet images" /%}

After pressing the _search_ button, Siri is activated behind the scenes to search the
internet and return results, **including images**. Again, imagine a less innocent search
than `goats`:

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/spotlight-search-results.png" caption="Search can use Siri to pull images and content from the internet" alt="five things you forgot locking down your kids iPhone: spotlight searching on iOS by default can load and display images from the web" /%}

{% click-to-reveal title="Show me how to fix it" %}

{% callout type="warning" alt=true %}

The fix for this one is unintuitive because if you have Siri disabled via Screen Time, the
controls you need to fix this loophole are **not visible,** which is why Step 1 is
required.

{% /callout %}

**Step 1.** Temporarily _allow_ the use of Siri by going to: Settings > Screen Time >
Content & Privacy Restrictions > Allowed Apps.

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/allowed-apps.png" caption="Go to 'Allowed Apps'" alt="five things you forgot locking down your kids iPhone: Screen Time > Allowed Apps" /%}

Then, _temporarily allow_ Siri & Dictation (you'll disable it again once we get the
Spotlight searching features disabled).

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/enable-siri-dictation.png" caption="Temporarily <b>enable</b> Siri" alt="five things you forgot locking down your kids iPhone: temporarily enable Siri & Dictation" /%}

**Step 2.** Go back to the _main settings screen_, where you should now be able to see an
option for **Siri & Search**

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/siri-search-main.png" caption="Now you can find \"Siri & Search\" in the main Settings screen" alt="five things you forgot locking down your kids iPhone: now you can see \"Siri & Search\" in the main Settings app" /%}

Click to **disable "Show in Spotlight"**:

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/disable-show-in-spotlight.png" caption="DISABLE 'Show in Spotlight'" alt="five things you forgot locking down your kids iPhone: diable 'Show in Spotlight'" /%}

**Step 3.** Finally, now that Siri can no longer provide results to Spotlight (the name of
the built-in iOS search feature), you need to _reverse step 1_ by disabling Siri &
Dictation. Go to Settings > Screen Time > Content & Privacy Restrictions, and disallow
Siri & Dictation.

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/disable-siri-dictation.png" caption="<b>Disable</b> Siri again (same location as step 1)" alt="five things you forgot locking down your kids iPhone: re-disable Siri again in Screen Time" /%}

{% /click-to-reveal %}

## 4. Web Searching from iBooks, Notes, Kindle, and Other Apps.

Most apps that deal with text (like ebook readers, Bible apps, Notes, and **many more**)
allow the user to _highlight a search term and **"Look Up"**_.

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/lookup-books.png" caption="Most apps let you highlight a word, then tap 'Look Up'" alt="five things you forgot locking down your kids iPhone: highlight a word and tap 'Look Up'" /%}

Which brings up this:

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/look-up-results.png" caption="An example of images pulled from the web in response to a 'Look Up'" alt="five things you forgot locking down your kids iPhone: Look Up on iOS can access and display to your child images from the web" /%}

{% click-to-reveal title="Show me how to fix it" %}

{% callout alt=true %}

These steps are nearly identical to the fix for _Internet Content in Searches_, except for
what setting to disable in step 2.

{% /callout %}

**Step 1.** Temporarily _allow_ the use of Siri by going to: Settings > Screen Time >
Content & Privacy Restrictions > Allowed Apps. (We need Siri enabled to get to the
settings shown below.)

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/allowed-apps.png" caption="Go to 'Allowed Apps'" alt="five things you forgot locking down your kids iPhone: Screen Time -> Content & Privacy Restrictions > Allowed Apps" /%}

Tap to **temporarily enable** Siri & Dictation.

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/enable-siri-dictation.png" caption="Temporarily <b>enable</b> Siri" alt="five things you forgot locking down your kids iPhone: temporarily enable Siri to fix the other settings" /%}

**Step 2.** Go back to the _main settings screen_, where you should now be able to see an
option for **Siri & Search**

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/siri-search-main.png" caption="Now you can go back to 'Settings > Siri & Search'" alt="five things you forgot locking down your kids iPhone: now you can find 'Siri & Search' under the main Settings screen" /%}

Click to **disable "Show in Look Up"**:

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/disable-show-in-lookup.png" caption="DISABLE 'Show in Look Up'" alt="five things you forgot locking down your kids iPhone: disable 'Show in Look Up' to prevent showing your child images and content from the internet" /%}

**Step 3.** Finally, now that Siri can no longer provide results to "Look Up", you need to
_reverse step 1_ by disabling Siri & Dictation. Go to Settings > Screen Time > Content &
Privacy Restrictions, and disallow Siri & Dictation.

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/disable-siri-dictation.png" caption="<b>Disable</b> Siri again (same location as step 1)" alt="five things you forgot locking down your kids iPhone: re-disable Siri in Screen Time after fixing the other settings" /%}

## 5. Siri Internet Access

A frequent mistake parents make is to leave Siri fully or partially enabled. While Siri
can provide help for many harmless tasks, it can also bypass other restrictions to access
and _display almost any content on the internet._ To test if your child's device is
vulnerable, **ask Siri to show you pictures of something.**

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/siri-search.png" caption="An example of images found by asking Siri" alt="five things you forgot locking down your kids iPhone: Siri can show your child images and content from anywhere on the internet" /%}

Unfortunately, simply disabling Siri from the Screen Time settings is not sufficient to
fix this. Follow the steps below for instructions.

{% click-to-reveal title="Show me how to fix it" %}

**Step 1.** Before we disable Siri, we need to _adjust some settings._ Go to Settings >
Siri & Search:

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/siri-search-main.png" caption="Settings > Siri & Search" alt="five things you forgot locking down your kids iPhone: Settings > Search (in the main Settings app screen)" /%}

Then disable all of the options shown below. Doing so prevents Siri from providing
internet images and content when searching (Spotlight) or looking up definitions (Look
Up).

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/siri-disable-all.png" caption="Turn <b>all</b> of these settings OFF" alt="five things you forgot locking down your kids iPhone: disable all Siri system integrations for safety" /%}

**Step 2.** Disable app/Siri integrations. On the same settings screen from _Step 1_,
scroll down a bit further to find **individual app settings** for Siri, shown below:

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/siri-app-settings.png" caption="Individual app + Siri settings" alt="five things you forgot locking down your kids iPhone: here's where individual apps' integration with Siri can be controlled" /%}

_Tap on each app_ one at a time, and completely disable Siri from accessing/integrating
with the app:

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/disable-siri-app-settings.png" caption="Turn these all OFF for <b>every</b> app." alt="five things you forgot locking down your kids iPhone: turn off all app Siri connections for safety" /%}

**Step 3.** Disable Siri in Screen Time.

Go to the main _Settings_ app, and then navigate to "Screen Time > Content & Privacy
Restrictions"

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/content-privacy-restrictions.png" caption="Settings > Screen Time > Content & Privacy Restrictions" alt="five things you forgot locking down your kids iPhone: Settings > Screen Time > Content & Privacy Restrictions" /%}

Then to _Allowed Apps_:

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/allowed-apps.png" caption="Screen Time > Content & Privacy Restrictions > Allowed Apps" alt="five things you forgot locking down your kids iPhone: Allowed Apps (in Screen Time)" /%}

Then tap to _disable Siri & Dictation_:

{% image src="lockdown-iphone/disable-siri-dictation.png" caption="<b>Disable</b> Siri & Dictation" alt="five things you forgot locking down your kids iPhone: disable Siri and Dictation" /%}

## Bonus: Protecting Household Devices

If you checked and fixed all of the loopholes we've shown so far, and have
[locked down your child's iPhone](/blog/definitive-guide-to-locking-down-an-iphone) using
Screen Time, then you're doing great. But there's one more thing most parents forget:
**most households have many internet-connected devices, ALL of which must be protected
with passwords.** Take a minute to do a thorough review of all the phones, computers, and
devices in your house, including:

- your phone and your spouse's
- all computers, including yours
- phones, iPads, or tablets used by younger/older siblings
- old devices lying around in closets and cupboards

All of these devices must be _secured with passwords_ or have unsafe apps/priveleges
removed. If this seems extreme, I assure you it's not. A couple I know found out too late
that their 13 year old son was taking a laptop from their bedroom at night while they
slept in order to fuel a growing pornography addiction.

Also, if your devices are protected with passwords, you need to **change those passwords
regularly.** Most people re-use the same passwords for many accounts and devices. Kids are
smart enough to figure this out, and yours probably already know your favorite password.

{% callout title="But <b>my</b> kid's a good kid..." type="warning" %}

Don't fall into the trap of thinking _"it won't happen to **my** kid, he/she is such a
good kid!"_

No other generation in history has had access to what can now be found on the internet
with a few clicks. Millions of well-raised, innocent kids from good families are getting
permanently scarred by the addicitive nature of content they should never have known even
existed.

You **absolutely can** protect your kid, but you're going to have to make up your mind to
be proactive and diligent. It will cost you a little time, and some inconvenience, but it
is **completely worth it**.
