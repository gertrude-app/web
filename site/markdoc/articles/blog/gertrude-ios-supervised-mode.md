The Gertrude Blocker iOS app **plugs several important holes** in Apple's Screen Time
parental controls, including adding the ability to block searching for and viewing
animated GIFs in the `#images` feature of the texting app Messages.

However, Apple currently only allows the app to work on devices that are signed in to
Apple Accounts for children under 18. Sadly, this makes harder to use for anyone over 18
who desires to restrict access to certain content for themselves, or in a relationship of
accountability.

We really wish Apple would change this policy, but until then, there are two ways to work
around this limitation:

1. If it it's possible to use a different Apple Account for the device, registered to an
   under 18 account (perhaps a sibling), this is the easiest way. It's also good to know
   that
   [Apple does permit you to change the birthdate](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102473)
   on an Apple Account.
2. The other way is to put the device into **Supervised Mode**. This is a special mode
   designed for schools and businesses, which allows additional options, controls and
   restrictions. It is very powerful, but _more difficult to set up._

## Before you start

If you'd like to use Gertrude for iOS and you're over 18, it's definitely possible and
worth the effort. Here's a couple key things you need to know before you get started:

1. **You will need a Mac computer** to set up Supervised Mode. If you don't have one,
   you'll need help from a trusted friend who does, and who can help you from time to time
   going forward even after the initial setup.
2. You will be **temporarily erasing the device** completely in order to set up Supervised
   Mode. If you have a recent backup, you should be able to restore all important content
   and data.
