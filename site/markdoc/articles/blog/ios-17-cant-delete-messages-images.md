  'Sadly, iOS 17 removes a vital parental control: the ability for parents to disable
  animated GIF searching through the #images iMessage app. This exposes children to
  thousands of extremely innappropriate images.'

{% .lead .mb-12 %} Until iOS 17, parents could remove the dangerous iMessage app called
`#images`, but the latest release removes this control, exposing millions of kids to
graphic sexual content.

{% callout title="UPDATES: 10/2024" %}

1. A workaround for iOS 17 has been found&mdash;if you set a scheduled **Downtime** to be
   essentially always on (by starting at 3:01am and ending at 3:00am), the #images GIF
   search will stop working. All other apps that the parent wants to allow then must be
   categorized as _Always Allowed_, and you lose the ability to use Downtime for its
   intended purpose. (Note: test by searching with a brand new term, as previously loaded
   and cached images will still be visible after the workaround is applied.)
2. The iOS 17 Downtime workaround
   [does not appear to work for iOS 18](/blog/ios18-screentime-what-parents-should-know).
   Parents are urged to keep their children's devices on iOS 17 or earlier if possible.
3. Check back for updates, as we're working on a free iOS app that will patch these
   loopholes for parents. We hope to have the app ready by November 1, 2024.

Apple's texting app "Messages" comes with a feature that allows you to search for animated
GIFs to insert into texts, including **many images that are extremely innappropriate for
children.**

If you've never tried it, this iMessage app allows searching for animated GIFs. In the
image below, you can see the result of a search for `goats`, but a less innocent search
would **fill the screen with images not suitable for children**.

{% callout title="How dangerous is it?" %}

While the #images GIF search seems to block full nudity and certain explicit searches, it
still grants access to _thousands of sexually graphic images_ that most parents would
never permit young children to see. Try searching for `bikini` or `lingerie` if you're
skeptical, and remember that millions of children have iPhones.

iOS 17 _does allow removing **third party** iMessage apps_ through a new Settings area.
But the apps provided by Apple do not appear as options to disable.

{% callout title="<b class='text-2xl'>What should parents do?</b>" %}

1. Please take **2 minutes** to file a
   [bug report here](https://www.apple.com/feedback/messages-ios-ipados.html), letting
   Apple know that this is a serious problem you care about. The more people who report
   the issue, the sooner it will get fixed.
2. Help raise awareness and increase the pressure on Apple by **sharing this article** on
   social media.
3. If your kids' iOS devices aren't updated to iOS 17 yet **don't update, stay on iOS 16**
   until Apple fixes the issue. iOS 16 will work well for several years at least.
4. If you've already updated, we recommend temporarily crippling the Messages app by
   setting it to be allowed only for 1 minute each day, with ScreenTime's
   [App Limits](/blog/definitive-guide-to-locking-down-an-iphone) feature.
