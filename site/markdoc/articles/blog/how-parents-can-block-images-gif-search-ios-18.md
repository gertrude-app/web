Apple's built-in `#images` iMessage app for GIF search, built directly into the Messages
text-messaging app, has been a source of frustration to parents since iOS 17 was released
in September 2023. [Many](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255165706)
[parents](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/254820669)
[have](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/254724878)
[pleaded](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8117088)
[with](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/251774575)
[Apple](https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/1c09fvp/how_to_block_images) to restore the
ability for them to disable this feature, which exposes their kids to thousands of
unwanted pop-culture animated GIFs including many with sexual or violent content.

When iOS 18 was released in September 2024 the situation was even worse: the one hacky
workaround which worked for iOS 17 (which required disabling another parental control
feature, Downtime) no longer worked. Plus,
[new holes in Screen Time](/blog/ios18-screentime-what-parents-should-know) were found,
including the inability for parents to restrict image searches through Spotlight. So we
ended up taking matters into our own hands and built
[a free iOS app called “Gertrude Blocker”](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gertrude-blocker/id6736368820)
to solve this problem for parents.

## Introducing “Gertrude Blocker”

[Gertrude Blocker](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gertrude-blocker/id6736368820) is a free
iOS app that allows parents to install a network content filter that plugs several glaring
holes in Apple's Screen Time parental controls, including: (at the time of this writing in
10/2024):

- **disabling #images GIF search** in Apple's Messages text-messaging app
- blocking animated GIFs in **WhatsApp, Skype,** and other messaging apps
- prevents **images searched via Spotlight** from loading (not currently possible to
  restrict by parents in iOS 18)
- **removing images from the App Store** iMessage mini-app in Apple Messages (not
  currently removable by parents)
- **blocking AI search results** embedded in iOS 18 Photos App

{% callout title="Who can use Gertrude Blocker?" %}

Because of rules put in place by Apple, Gertrude Blocker only works on devices signed in
to an iCloud account registered to a _minor (under 18)_ who is part of an _Apple Family
Sharing group_ with a parent or guardian.

If you haven't created a Family Sharing group,
[see here for instructions](https://support.apple.com/en-us/108380).
