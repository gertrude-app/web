{% .lead .mb-8 %} **TLDR;** Parents can now _flag screenshots and keystrokes_ while
reviewing child activity. Flagged items can't be deleted for 60 days, giving your more
time to review with a spouse or discuss with your child.

Until now, when reviewing your child's activity, it was difficult to \*preserve specific
screenshots or keystrokes that needed further investigation or discussion. You had to keep
entire days of activity to avoid losing important items, making them hard to find later.

Several parents requested a way to flag items for later review, especially when both
parents are involved. So we've just shipped a new feature that lets you flag child
activity by _clicking a flag icon_ under any item.

After flagging an item, you can delete the rest of the day's activity as normal, but
flagged items will be preserved for 60 days and remain available for review until
unflagged and deleted. Days containing flagged items will be marked as shown below:

Let us know what you think! And keep the feature requests coming!
