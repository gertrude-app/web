## Kids online activity shouldn't be private

If you had the time to sit next to each of your kids for all of their daily computer
usage, that would be ideal. You would be able to _see everything they did,_ keep them away

Sadly, most of us don't have the time or bandwidth to watch our kids screens 100% of the
time. But technology can help us here. Gertrude comes with a built-in mac keyogger which
can record everything your child types, and also take regular screenshots of all of their
activity. All of their typing is securely uploaded to your parental account, where you can
review it for up to 2 weeks afterwards, on your phone or computer

## Not Spying, Accountability and Safety

secretly under any circumstances. We clearly notify your child _the entire time their
typing is being recorded_. If you're looking for some way to do this secretly, you're in
the wrong place. Again, the right mental model is that of a parent sitting next to their
child. They should know they are being watched--both because it respects their privacy,
