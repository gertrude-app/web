{% .lead %} More and more kids are using Mac computers for school these days. To keep your
kids safe and innocent, you need a high-quality mac internet filter to keep them exactly
and only where you want them to be.

## The Internet is a Huge, Not-So-Clean Place

According to recent estimates, there are over **2 billion** websites on the internet, with
over _250,000_ being created every day. There are a ton of innocent and educational
websites out there, but sadly they are mixed in with a **tremendous amount of dangerous
content**. Studies have indicated that perhaps **37% of the internet is pornography**.

## An Illusion of Safety...

Most mac website blockers work by attempting to _categorize all of the websites_ into
buckets like "adult", "gambling", "social media", etc. This seems promising&mdash;just
exclude the bad parts, and you'll be left with a safe internet, right? Sadly, no. With 2
billion websites, and 3 new ones created **every second** these lists are _always
hopelessly out of date_. We like to say that these types of parental controls app provide
only _the illusion of safety_. If you want to feel like you're keeping your kids safe,
turn on a mac internet filter that blocks by category. But if you want to _actually
protect your kids_, you'll need another approach.

## How to Block the Whole Internet...

The only way to make a macOS website filter that is actually safe is to forget trying to
categorize websites. Instead, every single website must be "guilty until proven
innocent"&mdash;blocked unless it has been specifically allowed by you as the parent.
However, there are very few tools that exist that work in this mode, and the ones that do
are almost so difficult to use that they're not worth it.

I was a dad and a computer programmer who got so frustrated with the lack of usable
parental controls for blocking the internet that I built my own app. Gertrude is the mac
internet filter I wished existed five years ago. It's simply the safest tool on the market
for parents who truly care about and are willing to invest a little time in the online
safety of their kids. It's internet filter only has one mode&mdash;block everything you
haven't explicitly safe-listed.

## ...Without Driving Yourself Crazy

It takes some time and effort to build up a safe-list so that your kids can access they
sites and apps they need for school, while you keep your peace of mind. Gertrude tries to
make this easy by:

- Allowing you to unblock websites from your own phone or computer. Rule updates are sent
  through the internet to your kids mac computers, instantly updating their protection
  settings.
- Allowing you to create groups of unblocked websites (called "keychains" in Gertrude),
  and share them between your kids.
- Providing a growing list of curated keychains that _unblock popular educational
  websites_, getting you up and running fast.
- Giving your kids a window into what requests are being blocked, if they're having
  trouble accessing some site they need. Gertrude lets them _isolate the blocked website,_
  and send you a notification, requesting an unblock. If you accept (from wherever you
  receive your text/email messages), they get access right away.
- Layering on _additional protections_ by offering background screenshots to be taken of
  all your kids's activity, plus privacy-respecting keylogging to capture and allow you to
  monitor everything they type. When combined with the strict mac website filter Gertrude
  provides, these tools add up to an incredibly powerful combination for keeping your kids
  safe online.
