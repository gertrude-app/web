{% .lead %} Using Gertrude is the cornerstone of keeping your kids safe online, but it
can't prevent every kind of problem. Take a few minutes to review this list of tips and
common mistakes.

## Remember what's at stake

It's going to take time, effort, and diligence to keep your kids safe on the internet. It
will be annoying and frustrating at times, and will interrupt your day frequently. There
will always be a temptation to simplify your life by disabling protections and telling
yourself that "my kid's a good kid, he'll be OK". Settle it ahead of time that you're
willing to put in the time and effort to actually keep them safe. Gertrude helps a huge
amount, but no tool can make this perfectly easy.

Look up some statistics on pornography addiction. The numbers are heart-breaking and
overwhelming. If you have a pre-teen or teenager (of either sex) with unrestricted access
to the internet, there's almost a 100% chance they will be exposed to (or more likely,
develop an addiction to) pornography. The danger is incredibly real, and far more serious
than most realize.

## Be careful with passwords

Gertrude is only as safe as the _admin account password_ protecting it. If your users know
your password, or can guess it, all bets are off. Once they can authenticate as an admin,
they can remove or disable all of Gertrude's protections.

If you use the same password for many things, or if your computer password is easy to
guess, or easy to type, or hasn't been changed for a long time, your kids may very well
already know it. We recommend _changing your password regularly,_ and being careful not to
type it while your kids are watching. I require my kids to _look away_ or be in another
room whenever I'm typing a password.

This also goes for your _Gertrude web admin account_. Your users should not know the
password for that account, or have access to a computer where you are logged in as the
admin.

## Let them know you're watching

If you're using Gertrude's _monitoring features_ (screenshots and keylogging), make sure
that you're periodically reviewing them in the admin web dashboard. Specifically, make it
a point to _frequently mention something you saw or read_ while reviewing your activity.
This way, they will always know that everything they do on their computer is truly being
watched, which is often as effective in keeping them in safe places as the filter itself.
It takes a little bit of time each day or each week to do this, but it's truly worth it.

## Discuss the "why"

The internet is a fantastic place in many ways, but it has an incredibly dark side. Talk
to your kids frankly about the dangers, and your own experience (good and bad) with the
internet and its temptations. If they deeply understand and agree with _why_ you're trying
to keep them safe, you'll convert them to an ally, and provide them with more motivation
to stay careful and innocent when presented with opportunities.

## Practice layers of internet safety

The best defense is a "defense in depth." Layer on other means of safety like:

- requiring computer use to be done in public places, with the screen visible
- remove computers from kids at night
- don't give your kids a phone, or make sure it is extremely locked down
- keep your home wifi password a secret
- put your wifi on a schedule, auto-disabling at night, if your router supports it

## Be thoughtful about other settings

If your own computers are carefully protected, that can't protect your kids from what
their peers or friends might expose them to on unprotected phones or computers. Think very
carefully about where and who your kids have access to, and consider making changes. Be
willing to have an awkward conversation requiring all phones and devices to be collected
and removed before you kids can play with friends with unprotected or partially protected
devices.
