Gertrude is built so that after the initial setup, you can _manage your protected users
from any computer, phone or device where you have access to the internet._ You don't need
physical access to your kids' computer to unblock websites, or grant filter suspensions,
or review their online activity. You can do this from your own computer or phone no matter
where you are.
